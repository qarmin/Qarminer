# List of all available settings which can be set

## General:

custom_classes: Array # Allows only use only provided by user classes(arguments will not take this into account)
function_exceptions_replace: Array # Replace functions which will be ignored with provided by user
function_exceptions_append: Array # Adds additional functions to be ignored
function_exceptions_remove: Array # Removes provided functions from ignored
disabled_classes_replace: Array # Replace classes which will be ignored with provided by user
disabled_classes_append: Array # Adds additional classes to be ignored
disabled_classes_remove: Array # Removes provided classes from ignored
allowed_functions: Array # Only allows to use this functions

## FunctionExecutor tool:

debug_print: bool  # Switch to turn off printed things to screen
exiting: bool  # Close app after first run
add_to_tree: bool  # Adds nodes to tree
delay_removing_added_nodes_to_next_frame: bool  # Delaying removing nodes added to tree to next frame, which force to render it
add_arguments_to_tree: bool  # Adds nodes which are used as arguments to tree
delay_removing_added_arguments_to_next_frame: bool  # Delaying removing arguments(nodes added to tree) to next frame, which force to render it
use_parent_methods: bool  # Allows to use parent methods e.g. Sprite can use Node.queue_free()
use_always_new_object: bool  # Don't allow to "remember" other function effects
number_of_function_repeats: int  # How many times all functions will be executed in single class
number_of_classes_repeats: int  # How much times class will be instanced in row(one after one)
allow_to_use_notification: bool  # Allows to use notification function in classes,to use this, parent methods must be enabled
shuffle_methods: bool  # Mix method execution order to be able to get more random results
miss_some_functions: int  # Allows to not execute some functions to be able to get more random results
remove_returned_value: bool  # Removes returned value from function(not recommended as default option, because can cause hard to reproduce bugs)
save_data_to_file: bool  # Save results to file
test_one_class_multiple_times: bool  # Test same class across multiple frames - helpful to find one class which cause problems
save_resources_to_file: bool # Saves created resources to files



# Usage Example
# All settings needs to be saved in settings.txt, which is placed under res://(which is just main fuzzer folder)
# # at the beginning means that this line will be ignored
# Empty lines also are ignored

# Settings which takes bool, float or int value, must be wrote in this way
add_to_tree: false
# which means that add_to_tree was set to false

# Settings which takes an array of strings as arguments, must be wrote in this way
custom_classes:
class1
class2
class3
# and this will create an array with 3 elements.

# Errors about parsing and end results are printed to console

# Example of settings.txt file
add_to_tree: true
allow_to_use_notification: false
allowed_functions: # Comments at the end of line are supported
remove_from_tree
add_node
print

shuffle_methods: false
